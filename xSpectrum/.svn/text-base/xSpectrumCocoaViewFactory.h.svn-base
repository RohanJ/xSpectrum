/*
 Apple Developer's NOTE: 
 It is important to rename ALL ui classes when using the XCode Audio Unit with Cocoa View
 template. Cocoa has a flat namespace, and if you use the default filenames, it is possible
 that you will get a namespace collision with classes from the cocoa view of a previously 
 loaded audio unit.	We recommend that you use a unique prefix that includes the manufacturer 
 name and unit name on all objective-C source files. You may use an underscore in your name, 
 but please refrain from starting your class name with an undescore as these names are 
 reserved for Apple.
